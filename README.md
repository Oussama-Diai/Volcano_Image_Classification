# Detection of Mars volcano Images
### Description:
The planet mars dataset is composed of images of mars. The goal is to detect on the
images the presence of volcanoes. For this, descriptors were calculated using firstly a median filter
then the HOG method. The most noisy images have been removed, but some still retain some noise.
